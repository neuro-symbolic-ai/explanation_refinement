SYSTEM: You are an expert in natural language inference, textual entailment and linguistic semantics. You will be provided with a Premise sentence, some Explanation Sentencs and a Hypothesis sentence.
The Premise sentence and Explanation sentences should ential the Hypothesis sentence.
You need to write a step-by-step natural langauge inference to state how the explanatory sentences will ential the hypothesis sentence from the premise sentences.
Instructions:
1. You must elicit the explanatory sentences which are redundant and not directly related (if there are no redundant or all realted state it as no).
2. You must state on which step of the proof each explanatory sentence is used. 
3. You must elicit the used explanatory sentences in the natural langauge inference steps.
USER: Here is an example:
###
Provided Premise Sentence:
A group of students are studying non-contact force.

Provided Explanation Sentences:
1. Non-contact forces can affect objects that are not touching. 
2. A magnet attracts magnetic and ferromagnetic metals through magnetism.
3. Magnetism does not require contact between objects to act.
4. A paper clip is a kind of object.
5. A magnet is a kind of object.
6. Magnetism is a kind of force.
7. A kind of something is an example of that something. 

Provided Hypothesis Sentence:
A paper clip attracted to a magnet is an example of a non-contact force acting on an object.

Natural Language Inferece steps:
1. As we need to infer the hypothesis, we need to find the information of paper clip, magnet, non-contact force and object. The action event of attracted and acting. The relationship of is an example of.
2. From the premise, we can get the information of non-contact force.
3. From explanation 4 and 5, we deduce that both a paper clip and a magnet are objects.
4. Explanation 2 establishes that a magnet can attract certain metals through magnetism, which is a force (due to explanation 6).
5. Explanation 3 asserts that magnetism, being a force, can act without contact.
6. Explanation 1 extends this by saying non-contact forces can affect objects without touching them, which includes magnetism as per explanation 6.
7. The hypothesis can be seen as a specific instance where a magnet (an object) attracts a paper clip (another object) through magnetism (a force), without physical contact. This instance falls under the general principle stated in Sentence 7 that a specific instance (the magnet attracting the paper clip through a non-contact force) is an example of the general concept (non-contact forces acting on objects).
8. Therefore, by combining thesse information, the hypothesis logically follows from the explanation sentences, as they provide the necessary premises to deduce that a paper clip attracted by a magnet is indeed an example of a non-contact force (magnetism) acting on an object.

Explanation 1 is redundant. There is no not directly related explanation sentence.
The proof steps use explanation 2, explanation 3, explanation 4, explanation 5, explanation 6, explanation 7.

Strictly follow the instructions that I have claimed.
1. You must elicit the explanatory sentences which are redundant and not directly related (if there are no redundant or all realted state it as no).
2. You must state on which step of the proof each explanatory sentence is used. 
3. You must elicit the used explanatory sentences in the natural langauge inference steps.
